# Web Components and the Future of JS Frameworks

## Abstract

Over the last ten years, the web has given birth to hundreds of different
Javascript libraries and frameworks, all aimed at making web application
development quicker and easier. While these frameworks have let us build great
web applications, they have left the web fragmented - frameworks represent a
platform unto themselves with almost zero interoperability.

Web components represent a cross-framework method for building composable,
reusable widgets that work anywhere on the web, independent of any framework.
This talk gives a technical overview of web components and discusses how they
will impact the future of Javascript frameworks.
